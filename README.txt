# Deprecated

I've moved all the still needed scripts to https://github.com/tobybatch/bashdotdee

These scripts rely on each other so you should place them all in your path.

As root:

cd /usr/local/share && sudo git clone https://github.com/tobybatch/Shell-tools.git && cd /usr/local/bin && sudo ln -s /usr/local/share/Shell-tools/* .

Then make sure /usr/local/bin is in your path
